# phase-1-Flatacuties
For this challenge,I am working on Flatacuties, an app where you can vote for the cutest animal

I am creating four deliverables, the first one is to ensure the list of animals can be seen when the page is loaded.

The second deliverable is when i click the animals name it should display the animal's image and votes .

The third deliverable is when viewing the animals details one should be able to add the number of votes for each animal and the votes should be displayed together with the animal's details.

The fourth deliverable is to create a container where one can add an animal to the list.
